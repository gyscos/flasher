Flasher is a service to automatically format or backup flash drives when inserted.

It is meant to be installed on a small computer board (like a Raspberry Pi Zero) with a single USB port, to easily prepare flash drives before use.

The action performed (backup / format, filesystem used, ...) depends on physical controls connected to the computer.
